<p class="ui header product-top-header" title=" Program that asks the user to enter their name and their age Solution">Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old. 2. Take two integer values from the user and return their sum. Unless the two values are the same, then return double their sum. 3. Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user. Hint: how does an even / odd number react differently when divided by 2? You may also want to Google about the modulus operator and how to use it in Python 4. Take 2 integers, a and b. Return True if one of them is 10 or if their sum is 10. 5. Take an integer n, return True if it is within 10 of 100 or 200. Note: abs(num) computes the absolute value of a number.
